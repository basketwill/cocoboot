Cocoboot Loader
---------------

Cocoboot allows you to load and run a Linux kernel on a PalmOS 5 based
handheld. It is conceptially based on the Garux loader but attempts to 
autodetect all the information that is required so that one binary can
be used for all handhelds, without any need for modification.

Cocoboot is currently developed and maintained by members of the Hack&Dev 
project, see AUTHORS for details.

Compiling:

You will need prc-tools, pilrc and the Palm OS SDK installed. Then simply
use "make" to build. You might need to adjust the paths in the Makefile
if your SDK is in a non-standard place.

USB Console:

Cocoboot includes a primitive USB console which you can use for dumping
memory and other debugging pruposes.  Enable it from Cocoboot's Tools menu.
Plug your PDA's USB into your PC, make sure you have the visor.ko kernel
module loaded and you should see two serial ports appear as /dev/ttyUSB0
and /dev/ttyUSB1.  Connect to /dev/ttyUSB0 using minicom with a baud rate
of 115200 to access the console.

Note: You may need to use ttyUSB1 on some devices such as the LD.
