Cocoboot Loader
---------------

Cocoboot allows you to load and run a Linux kernel on a PalmOS 5 based
handheld. It is conceptially based on the Garux loader but attempts to 
autodetect all the information that is required so that one binary can
be used for all handhelds, without any need for modification.

Cocoboot is currently developed and maintained by members of the Hack&Dev 
project, see AUTHORS for details.
